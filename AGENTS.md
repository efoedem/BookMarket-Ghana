- Seller ownership is stored on books and snapshotted on order items; this preserves seller sales after a book is removed.
- Admin reads and writes use the authenticated RLS client; private seller order projections use admin_sales to avoid revealing other sellers' items or whole-cart totals.
- Admin email grants are durable invitations bound to confirmed auth emails, never user-editable profile email or metadata.
